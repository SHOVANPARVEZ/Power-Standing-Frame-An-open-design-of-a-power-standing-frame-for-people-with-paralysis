# Active Stander - An open design of a powered standing frame for people with paralysis

### OBJECTIVES:
<P align="justify"> The objective of the project was to design a low-cost electrically powered standing frame for people with paralysis.</P> 

### DESCRIPTION:
<P align="justify"> For people with paralysis caused by spinal cord injuries and other neurological condition, regular standing offers a viable remedy for preventing secondary injuries like pressure ulcer. The goal of our project is to create an actuator controled electric standing frame that is both affordable and effective in reducing pressure ulcer risks and improving general health of these individuals. Our active stander offers people a safe, comfortable way to stand while enhancing bone density, muscular mass, and cardiovascular health by utilizing creative design and open-source collaboration. We value diversity and invite input from communities, healthcare providers, and users to improve and personalize the technology. Together with us, the standing frame will transform the well-being and mobility of paraplegic people all around the world.</P>

###
- Back support: Conventional wheelchiar back support is use. In addition a chaise belt is attached to the back support to protect the user from falling during the transition to standing position from sitting position.
- Link shaft: The seat and back support of the chair are held erect by link shafts as the chair transforms to the standing position.
- Seat cusion: Conventional seat cusion is used. It does not pose any discomfort to the user either in sitting or standing position.
- Electric actuator: Electric actuator are used to assist the wheelchair in transforming from sitting to standing position.
- Controller: This controller using for actuator oparating.
- Knee guard: Another essential componet of our standing wheelchair since it is designed for the users who have no strength in their legs. The knee guards prevent the knee from collapsing and help the users stand upright.
- Base frame: The main frame of the wheelchair that holds every parts of the Standing frame together. Each part can be mounted and unmounted to the base frame which allows low repair costs.
- Chest support: Chest support for a standing frame stabilizes and ensures proper posture for users with limited mobility, enhancing safety and comfort..
- Footrest: This special footrest is used to support the user's feet while sitting and standing. During the transition from a sitting to a standing position, the footrest height changes to allow safe standing.
 
### DISCLAIMER:
<P align="justify"> The design is offered as it is. Although it has been regorously tested by a number of paraplegic wheelchair users, we do not provide any warranty in any aspect.</P>

### WARNING:
- The device is intended stricktly for research and education purposes.
- The wheelchair is not certified for use without receving prior approval from a local safety board or review committee.
